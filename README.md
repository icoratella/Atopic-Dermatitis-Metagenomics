# Atopic Dermatitis Metagenomics
Atopic dermatitis: an inside look at the role of the skin microbiome.
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a widespread chronic skin inflammatory disease characterized by
dysbiosis, an overgrowth of Staphylococcus aureus, and a relative reduction in commensal
species. This study examined microbiome variations in adult patients suffering from severe AD to
deepen our understanding of the primary bacterial components linked to this disorder.
Furthermore, it also explored the therapeutic impact of Dupilumab on the skin microbiome of AD
patients.

Skin swabs were collected from the lesional (LE) and non-lesional (NL) skin areas of 16 patients
with severe AD and 15 healthy subjects (HS) as control. These samples underwent 16S rRNA
gene amplicon sequencing before and after a four-month Dupilumab treatment period. The severity
of the disease was evaluated using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI).
Microbiome analysis resulted in significantly higher alpha diversity in lesional tissues (LE) and in
non-lesional tissues (NL) than in healthy subjectsâ€™ tissues (HS). Moreover, linear discriminant
analysis Effect Size showed a significant increase of S. aureus and S. lugdunensis in LE compared
to NL and HS. Conversely, a substantial decrease in the relative abundance of the
Propionibacterium genus was described in LE and NL than HS. After four months of treatment with
Dupilumab, the alpha diversity in the AD patients was comparable to that in HS, and the relative
abundance of S. aureus significantly decreased compared to baseline.

This study revealed critical differences in the skin microbiome between healthy individuals and AD
patients. Treatment with Dupilumab led to a substantial decrease in S. aureus burden, supporting
its potential as a therapeutic option. A deeper understanding of the dynamics modulating the AD
microbiome might be crucial to finding specific biomarkers and providing better AD diagnosis and
treatment.
