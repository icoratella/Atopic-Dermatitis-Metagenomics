## Atopic Dermatitis: An Inside Look at the Role of the Skin Microbiome
Hello! In this project, I conducted a metagenomic analysis to characterize the microbiome associated with severe Atopic Dermatitis across three different sample types. I focused on identifying variations in the adult AD microbiome and assessed the therapeutic effects of Dupilumab on the skin microbiome. This involved comparing baseline microbiome data with results post-Dupilumab treatment to elucidate its impact. Here you can read the abstract and some results! Enjoy :)

**Atopic dermatitis (AD)** is a widespread chronic skin inflammatory disease characterized by dysbiosis, an overgrowth of *Staphylococcus aureus*, and a relative reduction in commensal species. This study examined microbiome variations in adult patients suffering from severe AD to deepen our understanding of the primary bacterial components linked to this disorder. Furthermore, it also explored the therapeutic impact of Dupilumab on the skin microbiome of AD patients.

Skin swabs were collected from the lesional (LE) and non-lesional (NL) skin areas of 16 patients with severe AD and 15 healthy subjects (HS) as control. These samples underwent 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing before and after a four-month Dupilumab treatment period. The severity of the disease was evaluated using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI).

Microbiome analysis resulted in significantly higher alpha diversity in lesional tissues and in non-lesional tissues than in healthy subjectsâ€™ tissues. Moreover, linear discriminant analysis Effect Size showed a significant increase of *S. aureus*, and *S. lugdunensis* in LE compared to NL and HS. Conversely, a substantial decrease in the relative abundance of the *Propionibacterium* genus was described in LE and NL than HS. After four months of treatment with Dupilumab, the alpha diversity in the AD patients was comparable to that in HS, and the relative abundance of *S. aureus* significantly decreased compared to baseline.

This study revealed critical differences in the skin microbiome between healthy individuals and AD patients. Treatment with Dupilumab led to a substantial decrease in *S. aureus* burden, supporting its potential as a therapeutic option. A deeper understanding of the dynamics modulating the AD microbiome might be crucial to finding specific biomarkers and providing better AD diagnosis and treatment.
